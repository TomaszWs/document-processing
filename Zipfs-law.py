# Project Objec+ve:
# Analyse and try to comprehend Zipfâ€™s Law.
# Write a Python script to analyze and visualize Zipf's Law for a set of words
# in different text
# corpora corresponding to different years.
# Steps:
import math

# File Input:
# Write code to read data from mulAple text files, each represenAng a different
# year's
# corpus. The data is tab-separated, with columns indicaAng the rank, word, and
# frequency.

# Zipf's Law Calcula5on:
# Implement a funcAon (zipf) to calculate metrics related to Zipf's Law for a
# given
# word. This should include calculaAons for frequency, rank, and other relevant
# staAsAcs.

# Word Selec5on:
# Allow the user to input a list of words they are interested in analyzing.
# Ensure the
# code can handle a variable number of words.

# Data Analysis:
# Iterate through the data and apply the zipf funcAon to each word of interest.
# Collect
# the results for further analysis.

# Visualiza5on:
# Use matplotlib or another ploOng library to visualize the Zipfian distribuAon
# for the
# selected words. Consider different types of visualizaAons such as scaPer
# plots, line
# charts, or bar charts.

# Corpus Comparison:
# Extend the script to compare the Zipfian distribuAons across different
# corpora
# (years). Consider how the word frequency distribuAon changes over Ame.
# Sta5s5cal Analysis:
# Enhance the script to calculate addiAonal staAsAcs or metrics related to word
# frequency and Zipf's Law. Explore other linguisAc features or characterisAcs
# that can
# be derived from the given data.
